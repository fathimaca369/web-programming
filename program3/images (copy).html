<p>Ilahia Trust was designed and materialized by a group of eminent personalities hailing from the various socio-economic, cultural, political, and business environment in and around Muvattupuzha. It started functioning in 1992, and this flourishing organization has contributed a major share in extending the scope and reach of regional educational aspirations. Now Ilahia trust has 55 members. The establishment of a lower primary school (Kavumkara Muslim L.P. School) in 1992 was the beginning of its phenomenal growth. The starting of an English Medium School (CBSE Syllabus) named Ilahia Public School in the same year was another milestone. The establishment of Ilahia College of Arts and Science in 1995 was an assertion of its dedication to professional education.</p>
